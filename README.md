#### CS 583 Probabilistic Graphic Model

### Programming language

* Python


### Dependencies:

* `csv` for reading/writing
* `logging` and `python_log_indenter` for pretty console message
* `numpy` for numerical/matrix operations
* `matplotlib` for figure plotting
* `statsmodels` for linear regression
* `python_log_indenter` for indented logging output
* `sklearn` for Lasso regression


### Notice
I have manually *removed* the first row and first column (headers) of test and
train data file, to make my code more easy to write and read.
This is true for all three phases.
